Ziva

As I step back into my cell, I'm met with the sight of my overturned mattress and scattered belongings. I rush over and search desperately inside my pillow case to find the dried weeds missing.

My heart sinks as I consider the implications. Could the guards have taken them? It seems likely, of course they would take away anything that could be used to escape. They must have sent me to the cafeteria so they could search my cell with ease.

“Oh my…” Yafu says as he rounds the corner, “What happened?”

“Guards searched our cell,” I say, holding up the pillow.

“What were they looking for?”

The truth teeters on the edge of my lips, but I shrug instead. “I don’t know.".

I examine our belongings again. Only some specific areas received attention, while other areas were left untouched. The mattresses are overturned, and our pillows thrown and scattered, but my woolen blanket is still neatly folded at the foot of our bunk, and the books are still stacked neatly on the desk.

There are small traces of dirt and sand on the ground near the foot of the mattress—someone must have been kneeling or crouching down to search. Some slight scuff marks decorate the wall nearby, suggesting that someone had leaned against it.

The guards wouldn’t perform a routine search this way. No, this had to be done by a fellow prisoner; someone who was looking for a specific item.

But why my weeds?

Yafu brushes past me and snatches the pillow from the floor. He chucks it onto his bunk and climbs on top of his mattress, smoothing out the covering.

“Well,” he sighs, “I’m going to take a nap.”

While I sit on the floor, lost in thought, a small detail catches my eye. I pick up my pillowcase and inspect it closely. It looks different from the one I had before. The fabric is worn and frayed in different places, and the stitching along the edges is neater than before.

I frantically inspect my pillowcase, trying to find any other discrepancies. And then I see it. The small holes in the corner of the pillow that I haven’t bothered to repair are now neatly patched up.

Someone has not only taken my dried weeds but went to great lengths to cover their tracks.

My blood boils. I’ve been targeted, but who could have done this? And why?

─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───

The guard raises an eyebrow and gives me a skeptical look. "Replaced? You sure about that?"

The guard snorts and kicks his feet. I have to lower my gaze to speak to him, but he treats me as if he was the one looking down.

I nod. “Yes. If someone replaced your pillow with a similar but slightly different one, you’d notice.”

His eyes narrow and he leans in close. “Are you accusing us of stealing your pillow?”

“Er–Of course not,” I say frantically, shaking my head, “I just thought maybe it was a mix-up or something.”

He studies me for a moment before straightening up. “I’ll look into it, but I don’t think there is anything to worry about. Keep your head down and stay out of trouble.”

With that, he turns away, leaving me alone in the hallway . ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───

My dad was a construction engineer, so growing up I was always surrounded by building materials of every kind. I tried going into engineering, but the Venlil Exchange program dragged me away from that path. I run my fingers over the surface to feel the texture of the brick wall. It’s sturdy, but the mortar is thinner in some areas. Those are definitely weak spots.

Chipping right away at those spots would spell doom for me. How could I possibly hide a big hole in my cell? I need a paste; a thick substance the same drab color as my walls. I grab the tube of toothpaste sitting on my sink and squeeze out a line onto my hand. The texture’s too thin. I need a thickening agent.

I recall the meal Yafu scarfed down in a heartbeat yesterday. There was some sort of thick pudding in his tray. I make my way to the cafeteria, but two guards block my entry.

“It is currently not the time of eating hours,” says the guard, “come back later.”

I take a deep breath and straighten my posture, putting on the most confident smile I can manage. “Actually, I’m here for the new lunch lady position. I was told to come here at this time to talk to the head chef to apply.”

The guards exchange skeptical looks before one of them relents. “Fine, but make it quick. We’ll be watching you.”

I step inside the empty cafeteria. Looking through the serving line, I see stainless steel counters and industrial-grade ovens and stoves. Prisoners clad in hairnets that span their entire body busy away at preparing meals and cleaning dishes in a sort of organized chaos. The air’s filled with the sounds of clanging pots and pans, sizzling food, and the hum of the all-too-loud ventilation.

A wide variety of ingredients, including grains, vegetables, and plenty of spices line the shelves. Bags of what looks to be flour or starch lay sorted against the wall. I slip past the sign that says “NO ENTRY” and enter the kitchen unnoticed.

I tower over everyone, having to stoop a bit to avoid hitting my head on the low ceiling. The ovens and stovetops add to the already stuffy atmosphere, and I immediately start sweating. The workers, previously undistracted, eye me wearily as I approach. One of them, a woman with a no-nonsense look, steps forward.

“What do you want?” she asks, her voice gruff.

“Excuse me, ma’am,” I say, approaching her, “I was told to come to you to apply for the lunch lady position. Here I am.”

She looks at me up and down, as if gauging my usefulness.

“Can you cook?” she asks suspiciously.

“Er, Yes, I can cook.”

The woman snorts. “We don’t need any more help. We have enough cooks as of now.”

A pang of frustration rings through me. I need that thickening agent to make my paste. I look around desperately, searching for a plan. I spot a burnt out stove top that the cooks avoid like it's repellent.

“I have a background in engineering. Perhaps I could be of assistance in fixing any maintenance issues?”

Both our eyes fall upon the broken stovetop. “Can you fix that?” She asks.

I nod quickly. “I’ll have to look at it though.”

“Fine, take a look at it,” she nods, “but don’t screw anything up.”

I walk up to the broken stovetop. It’s a large, industrial-sized piece of equipment with eight burners. The thick metal on the top surface encloses each burner in a metal ring. This burner has seen better days. One of the rings is twisted and warped, as if it were torn out of place and then forced back into its original position. The control knob for that burner won’t budge when twisted, and the surface of the burner is blackened and charred.

“How long has this been out of order?” I ask the orderly next to me, who wheels loaves of bread to the counter.

“About a week. Maintenance guy bailed out on us so we’ve been waiting on a fix. The knob won't turn anymore and it caused the whole thing to catch fire.”

I inspect the knob more closely. It looks as it's been forcibly turned and twisted, causing the internal mechanism to break. Some of the metal pieces are bent out of shape. Someone must have used too much force to turn it. Scratch marks decorate the area around the knob…someone must have tried to pry it open with a tool but failed.

I can’t access the inside of the stovetop without a screwdriver…

Thinking creatively, I grab a spoon and examine it. I can use the stem of it as a makeshift screwdriver. With a little bit of maneuvering, I’m able to remove the screws and open up the stovetop.

The inside of the stovetop is even worse. Grease and grime decorate the walls, evidence of years of use without proper maintenance. Looking at the control knob from the inside, the valve stem is bent, causing it to stick and block the knob from turning.

After taking it out, I reach for the spoon and use it as a makeshift tool to carefully straighten the stem. I position the spoon head on the top of the valve stem and gradually apply pressure, bending the stem back into its original position. It takes a few attempts, but eventually the stem straightens up. With the control knob fixed, I reattach the knob and turn it on to test the burner.

It sputters to life for a moment before arising with a steady flame. I smile in satisfaction and grab the cleaning cloth.

For the next hour, I clean up every last bit of grime from the stove. When I’m done, my hands are black with soot and my eyes sting with every blink. The burner still needs replacement, but the internal issues are all fixed.

The head chef nods her approval. “Well tan my fur. I didn’t expect you to actually fix it!”

I grab a clean towel and wipe my face with it. “Thank you.”

She thinks for a moment before speaking up. “We could use an extra hand fixing things around here. Do you need any special items to continue your work?"

My eyes land on the bags of starch.
