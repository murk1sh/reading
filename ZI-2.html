Ziva

“Eat.” The computerized voice echoes through the cell.

I glance up, surprised to hear any kind of interaction. The last time I spoke to someone was when they threw me in here.

“Eat.” the computerized voice says again.

The little slider installed in the door opens with a clack. Someone slides a metal tray into the dock, and it slams shut.

“Eat.”

The food’s a mixture of greens and grains, each segregated into their respective bowls. I leave the meal on the dock. My cell is small, with just a cot in the corner, a sink, and a toilet. The only source of light comes from a tiny window high up on the wall, but it’s enough to make me feel like I’m in a fishbowl.

I clamber onto the toilet tank and attempt to peer outside. I barely get a glance before two strong arms pull me to the floor.

“Irregular activity.” says the computer.

I whip around to see two arms disappearing into the ceiling. It had seen me balance on the toilet, so they brought me to the floor.

The brief image I had of the outside is burned into my mind. There were grass and shrubs blocking my view of the outside, so I was on the ground floor. There’s definitely no way I’m breaking the window down—it's probably sturdier than the walls that surround me.

How could I even try when there’s a robot dictator that watches my every move?

There's a camera mounted in the corner above the door. I can’t reach it, but even if I could, what would I do? A glass covering protects it from all harm. I lie down on my cot—the cot of a convicted murderer.

I never even had a chance. I cooperated with them all the way—from my arrest to when they threw me in here. I told them the honest truth—that I had pushed a rowdy venlil to the ground in anger, that I had gone to buy a serrated knife, that I went home and hung out with my friend—but apparently it wasn’t enough.

I’ll bet if I cried on the stand, they would have called them crocodile tears too. I should be crying—I should wail and scream and crawl at the walls until my nails bleed—but instead I lie on my cot in silence. It’s a bizarre feeling.

“Eat.” suggests the robot.

I’m not in the mood to eat, but my stomach disagrees. It growls angrily in protest. I grab a stalk of the celery lookalike and take a bite. The food tastes flat—exactly like what celery would taste like. The texture’s a little different though; it's much more rubbery and chewy. I wash it down with sink water, feeling somewhat satisfied. I leave the tray on the floor and sit on my cot.

Now that I’m sated, I’m feeling a lot better about my situation. It’s time to brainstorm. I can’t get to the window—every time the camera spots me doing something abnormal, it brings me to the floor. The glass casing around the window is impenetrable, so prying it off would take a lot of effort and time. But I'm determined to find a way out of here.

An idea hits me. I grab a slice of bread and roll it into a little ball. I chew it until it becomes a viscous emulsion. Walking up to the camera, I slather it with the mixture. After making sure it’s completely covered in the substance, I walk back to the toilet tank and balance on it carefully.

No response from Mr. Robot Dictator.

My cell overlooks a largely unkempt section of grass. Half of the grass is overgrown with shrubs and other bushes. Periodically, little black devices pop out of the ground and start spraying water, which forms a mist cloud that covers the entire yard.

As I watch them water the plants, I can’t help but feel a sense of hopelessness wash over me. I really am trapped in this place.

My mind flutters with activity. What if the appeals fail and I’m stuck here for good? No, there had to be a way out. I could try escaping through the courtyard. The fence itself is a challenge—judging from pure estimation, they stand fifteen feet high. After that, open air, protected by two rolls of razor wire.

I can’t even jump five feet, let alone fifteen. And that’s not even considering the question of where would I go? Sure, I could scale the fence somehow, but then how would I get past the barbed wire? And how would I climb the fence without raising the alarm?

It had to be done at night. That means I would be locked in my cell. The walls here are made out of brick and mortar, so any sharp tool could easily carve out the mortar. Then, I could pry out the window. I could cut out the fence with wire cutters and escape.

But that was but a dream. Cutting through the mortar would take hours, maybe even days. With the camera observing me at all times, tricking it into thinking there wasn’t a big gaping hole in the wall would be a herculean task. How would I get my hands on some wire cutters in the first place? These questions loom over me.

Think, Ziva, think!

I could try scaling the prison roof once out. That would eliminate the need for wire cutters.

Then I could jump down from the prison roof and—

Two metal arms grab me and bring me to the floor. The bread-glue had fallen off. I’m left staring up at the arms folding into the ceiling. Any machinery complex enough to grab must have a huge compartment back there, so there’s probably a lot of empty space behind the ceiling.

I stumble to my feet and climb on the toilet once again, this time armed with a pillow. The arms come for me once again, but this time I’m ready for them. I stuff the pillow into their outstretched arms, and they clamp around it. I leap for one of the arms—

—and faceplant into the floor.

“Good day, Miss Ziva.”

Huh? I look up, still prone on the floor. The jailer’s here. He taps on the gadget strapped to his arm, and the cell unlocks.

He steps into the cell, a half-sneer on his face. “We’re keeping a very close eye on you,” he says. “Come with me.”

The jailer leads me down a long, highly lit corridor, his heavy footsteps echoing off the walls. I can hear the distant sounds of shuffling feet and low murmurs from fellow inmates as we pass by their cells. We turn several corners and pass through several metal doors that slam shut behind us, each one a reminder of how far from freedom I truly am.

After what seems like an eternity of marching, we reach the entrance to the courtyard. The guard prods me forward, and I step in.

The sun is blinding, casting long streaks of shadow across the expanse. I tug at my collar, already overheated. The jailer leads me to a bench in the center of the yard and leaves.

─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───

I sit in the corner of the prison yard, all alone. Being the only human incarcerated at Bellumak has made me an outcast among the prisoners and even the corrections officers. Their resentment towards me is palpable, as they nervously shuffle away at my approach and watch me warily from their posts.

I had arrived with high hopes for the interspecies exchange program, but the reality has been far from what I imagined. Despite the effort to promote understanding, most of the native venlil still fear us humans, with our front-facing eyes and all.

Too bad I’m not cute like them.

The unkempt section of the courtyard is riddled with small weeds and bushes. I’ve read books about people escaping using sheet rope crafted out of toilet paper and bedsheets before, but weeds seemed like an even more reliable rope material.

I start pulling out the tall, thin weeds one by one. The dirt is soft, and it gives way easily to my antics. Soon I realize it’s impossible to take back all the stalks without getting caught. I would have to bring them in one by one.

I carefully gather the lush green stalks of weed into a tidy stack. With a quick glance over my shoulder, I slip the bundle underneath a nearby bush, hiding it from view. Choosing one stalk, I begin carefully folding it, making it small enough to fit inside my worn prison shoes.

Testing the waters, I ungracefully sneak the single stalk back to my cell. There’s no point in risking taking all of them if I can’t even sneak one past the guards undetected. As I reach my cell, I quickly hide the stalk in my mattress, trying my best to block the camera’s view. My heart pounds as the sound of footsteps draws near, signaling the arrival of the jailer.

The two of us trod down the hallways in silence. I tower over him, but he shows no emotion.

Despite our height disparity, the jailer exudes confidence and coldness. He must be used to dealing with prisoners of all sizes.

The weight of my situation hits once again. I’m locked away in a state prison on a planet trillions of miles away from my home, and there’s little I can do. The mere thought of it brings tears to my eyes, but I quickly blink them away. The jailor, seemingly unfazed by the tension in the air, strides ahead.

“You’ve got a visitor,” he says as he leads me up a flight of steps.

“Who?”

He gives me a look that says hell if I know and opens the door at the end of the corridor.

The visitor’s room is a fairly spacious room, illuminated by a large skylight. A glass window divides the room in half, separating prisoner and visitor. I notice the corrections officers standing at the end of the room like statues. Each brandishes a gadget on their left forearm. They look bored, like they’ve seen it all.

The other prisoners in the room converse with their visitors in hushed tones, and the murmur of voices almost drowns out the fans churning air into the room. Among the line of visitors, I see Amai. He waves. I wave back.

I’m led to a spot directly opposite of him, and the sound of his chair scraping against the floor joins the chorus of voices echoing against the walls. He presses his face to the glass wall and attempts to smile as hard as he can. Instead, it comes out as a grimace.

“I can’t believe they locked you in here,” Amai says, “It’s so unfair.”

“I’m still trying to process it all, Amai…I just don’t understand why I’m here. I didn’t even kill that venlil…I was just defending myself, and now—”

My voice falters, already choked up with emotion.. My eyes well up with tears and my vision becomes blurry.

“I’m sorry, Ziva,” Amai says, his tail drooping. The conversation pauses for a second, and it becomes drowned out by the plump venlil yelling beside him, telling her husband that she’d left a box for him in the office.

“Is it going to be alright?” I ask after our moment of silence.

“I promise it’ll be alright, Ziva,” he says.

“How can you be so sure?”

“The appeal—We still have the appeal. You’ll get exonerated, and then everything will go back to normal. We’ll swim together, sundays.” He explains it so easily he might as well have been talking about cooking a dish. Sure, then you’ll add the tomatoes like this, and then stir in some water…

Yet I know it’s not so simple. Venlil courts only grants one appeal per convict, and my case isn’t looking so great. I had, after all, been convicted for murder of three venlil, and though the evidence was all circumstantial, It was still enough for my conviction.

I tell him we mustn’t lose hope. He brings a hand to the window, all claws parallel to the glass. I sniffle. Hardly thinking about it, I reach out to take his hand. There’s a wall separating the both of us, of course, so there’s little physical sensation, but it still feels natural. We lean our heads together, and the moment seems to linger.
