Ziva

My eyes creep slowly open, adjusting to the dimly lit prison cell. The ceiling greets me, and it occurs to me that it’s still nighttime. I lie there for a moment, trying to figure out what had woken me when someone rolls me to the side. A big fluffy animal fills my vision.

“What the—” I begin, but the intruder cuts me off.

“Hi,” the venlil intruder says, “I’m Yafu.”

I can't help but notice that he's not like any other venlil I've seen. For one, his tail is missing, replaced with a short stub at the base of his spine, and he's nearly as big as me. He climbs up a ladder that I don't recall seeing before and onto a second bed above me.

“I’m your new cellmate,” he chirps.

New cellmate?

“Computer! Get this intruder out of my cell!”

“REQUEST DENIED: YAFU PYOAKORYL IS IN CORRECT CELL. NO INFRACTION DETECTED.”

His head pops over the edge of the top bunk. “See?”

I shrug in response. “Why did they put you in here?”

“I don’t know. Something about scaring the other prisoners too much.”

I can't help but raise an eyebrow at this. "And why do they think you're scary?"

"I'm not scary!" he protests. His expression turns somber. "They pinned a murder on me. Five murders, actually."

“What? How?”

Yafu looks away, his eyes darkening. "I don't remember much about that day. But the case made national news."

I nod. He clambers down from his bunk and onto mine.

“The police had been investigating the case for months without any leads. The murders happened every week, and they were pressured to solve it fast. Even the head chief of police made a promise to catch the killer within a week. Which they did.”

I shift in my bed awkwardly. “So how did you end up getting caught up in it?”

“Well as I said, I don’t remember much. I do remember I was at a flower shop when suddenly a whole horde of officers descended upon me and took me away.”

“Why did they think you were the killer?” I ask.

Frustration and fear fills his eyes, and his tone drops.

“They found a few hairs on one of the victims, claimed they matched mine. They convicted me only off of that.”

“Wait, but that’s not enough to convict someone.” I say, trying to reassure him.

“Well it was enough for me. They thought they had their man.”

“Did you have a good lawyer?”

“He sucked. He didn’t even challenge the evidence, or point out how it was only one piece of evidence. I think I would have done better if I had no lawyer altogether. It was as if he was on the prosecution’s side.”

I reach out and put a hand on his shoulder. He does nothing to stop me. “That's awful. Did you appeal?”

“They denied my appeal,” Yafu says between sniffs, “They maintained that the evidence was enough to convict me. I don’t know what to do now.”

I squeeze his shoulder sympathetically. “I’m sorry that happened to you.”

Tears form in his eyes, and he looks away. “Thanks, Ziva…”

I take his hand and hold them in mine. “It's okay to cry,” I say softly.

Yafu shakes his head. “I can’t. Not here.”

Yafu falls back onto his bunk, and he lets out a deep sigh. I can see the exhaustion etched on his face as he sniffles, wiping away a stray tear that had escaped from the corner of his eye. His chest rises and falls heavily as he tries to calm himself. He sniffles. A sense of determination wells up inside me. I have to escape, not just for my own sake, but for Yafu’s too.

─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───

A good night’s rest later and…Yafu is still my cellmate. He’s snoring loudly, too.

I clamber onto his bunk and poke him. No response. I shake him. Still, the oversized creature doesn’t budge. I guess when Venlil goes to sleep, they like to stay asleep, and Yafu is no exception. I wouldn’t hold it against him, but it does get annoying when he’s in the way.

Move…

Aaaand…Move!

I’m not exactly the weakest human. Still, moving him is like trying to push a boulder, if that boulder was fluffy and warm and human-sized.

Move!

Summoning all of my strength, I manage to nudge Yafu to the edge of his bed. After that small victory, I focus on my next task. I retrieve the ball of dried weed and begin to methodically unravel it. Once I have a sizable amount, I deftly knot each end together, forming a long and sturdy rope that's nearly a foot taller than me. Satisfied with the first rope, I repeat the process to craft a second one, ensuring they're identical in length and quality.

Using one end of the rope, I secure it to the top bunk and climb onto the toilet with the other end in my grasp. It doesn't take long for the computer to detect my actions and react.

The computer quickly detects my movements and alerts with a robotic voice, "Irregular Activity." The metallic hands of the robot swiftly approach me, but this time I am prepared. I quickly dodge the swipe aimed at me, and with my free hand, I seize one of the arms and restrain it with the rope. The robot's free arm starts to flail wildly, attempting to break free from the knot. But before it can succeed, I am already on it, swiftly immobilizing it as well.

I hold into the robot arm with all my strength, refusing to let it slip away. Grasping for the second rope, I pull it towards me, scraping the robot arms against the ground as I do. With the rope in hand, I quickly tie it around the twisted arms, binding them together tightly.

As the computer continues to protest and thrash about, I steal a quick glance at Yafu and confirm that he’s still fast asleep. With the robot arms immobilized, I climb up onto them and reach the ceiling, where two small holes greet me. Although the openings are no more than an inch wide, I stick my hand through them, grasping for anything useful.

Just when I think I’ve found something, the rope holding the arms together start to unravel. I cling on with all my strength, but it’s no use. The arms break free, and I’m sent hurtling through the air. My head hits the ground with a sickening thud, and I see a few stars that aren’t necessarily in the sky. I try to get up, but the world spins around me, making me feel dizzy and disoriented. That’s when I feel a sharp poke in my arm.

A wave of tiredness washes over me.

“Noooooo….” I mumble. The last thing I remember is the robot gently laying me out on the floor.

─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───

Yafu’s standing over me when I wake up. He’s also grinning from ear to ear. How do I tell an alien is grinning when they don’t smile? You just kind of know as you spend more time with them.

“Good afternoon,” he says.

I sit up in bed, feeling disoriented. Blinking my eyes to adjust to the lighting, I realize that I’m lying in my bunk, with a warm blanket draped over me.

“Hey,” I croak, my voice hoarse and scratchy.

Before I can utter another word, the corrections officer appears at the door. He gestures for us to follow him.

“Where are we going?” I ask.

He’s stone cold silent as usual. I hesitate, wondering if this is some kind of trick.

I reason that there is no real motive for him to trick me, so I get up and follow him out of the cell, Yafu trailing behind me. We’re led down a long hallway before arriving at the prison cafeteria. The smell of stale food hits me as we enter the large room. Rows of tables and benches stretch out before us, with prisoners sitting and eating at them. The noise level is deafening, with people shouting and laughing and the clinking of silverware on plates. The smell of boiled plants permeates the air. Already the atmosphere is suffocating.

The guard leads me to a table in the corner of the room and motions for me to sit down. “Sit here,” he says gruffly.

Mr. Stone Cold leaves and so does Yafu. I see him bounce over to the back of the lunchline. It isn’t hard to mistake him for anyone else, as he stands out from the rest of the prisoners from his height alone.

As I glance down the line of prisoners waiting for their food, I see that they're all being served the same thing: a sad-looking pile of greens and some sort of mush that might have once been bread. There are no seasonings, no sauces, nothing to make the food even remotely appetizing. It's clear that the prison is cutting corners when it comes to the food budget, and the result is a bleak and unappetizing meal. The prisoners don’t seem to mind, though. They happily shovel forkfuls of the food into their mouths with little complaint.

Yafu slides into the seat next to me, his tray full.

“You going to eat anything?” he asks, pushing his plate to me, “I got enough for two.”

I look at the food on his plate and push the plate away, feeling my stomach churn. “No, I think I’ll pass,” I say, my voice barely above a whisper.

At least the food back in my cell was palatable…

Yafu looks at me quizzically, his mouth full of the substance. "What? It's good," he says with a shrug, as he chews and swallows.

I shake my head, still unable to bring myself to even try the food. It's as if my taste buds have shut down in protest. As I stare at the food in utter disgust, out of the corner of my eye, I see a prisoner staring daggers into me. His large, muscular frame is a stark contrast to the fellow inmates who eat around him, and he towers above all of them. His piercing yellow eyes seem to take in everything, especially me.

Before I can excuse myself, he stands up and strides towards me.

"I heard about what you did," he growls, his voice low and menacing.

"You don't belong here. We don't want your kind in our prison."

My mind races as I try to figure out what he's talking about. He must’ve found out about my case. I glance around nervously, noticing that several other prisoners have stopped eating to watch the confrontation. The prisoner leans in closer, his breath hot and foul. "You're a disgrace. You should leave before we make you leave."

Fear rises in my chest. Hairs rise up on my arms and my stomach churns with anxiety. I stand up, meeting his gaze with a steely resolve. "I'm not going anywhere," I say firmly, sounding more confident than I expected.

"You can't scare me off that easily."

The Venlil prisoner snarls, clearly not expecting such a bold response. For a moment, I fear he might attack me, but then he seems to reconsider. With a final warning glare, he turns and stalks away, disappearing into the crowd of prisoners. I sit back down, my hands shaking with adrenaline.

I look back at Yafu. He’s cowering underneath the table.
