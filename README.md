Hello. This is the first iteration of my website that stores all my creative writing. These stories are usually also available on reddit alternatively, though this site is much better!
For now, in order to use you must download it into a folder and open it in visual studio code. Then you must host a live server in order to run the html. I will port to an actual website soon :)
