Ziva

The grand jury of Venlil sit behind me like a bunch of roadkill on display—dumfounded and stupefied. A stout venlil—the public Prosecutor—rises. The fans churning hot air into the room lands on him when he stands. He looks like he could piss ice water.

“Mrs. Ziva,” he says in a nasty tone, “describe the confrontation you had with Klainis the night she was murdered.”

I’m instructed to stand. My neon green clothes reflect all the lights in the room, and I see the panel of Venlil shift a little away from me, like I’m bug repellent.

“It was a particularly nasty night,” I begin, “she said I was a threat to everyone and spat in my face.”

“And what did you do?”

“I ignored her.”

The public Prosecutor looks down at his notes. “You told her if she got any closer, you would punch her. Those were the words you said, Mrs. Ziva, according to the testimony of onlookers.”

I swallow dryly. “If that is what they say. I really don’t remember, I was upset and in great distress.”

The Prosecutor continues with his cross-examination. “What did you do after that confrontation?”

“I left.”

He straightens up like a spring wound too tight. “You left indeed. You left and then followed her to her house, where you quickly dispatched her with a knife, didn’t you?”

I tell him I did not do such action.

“You mean you slit the throats of Ismik and Potul first?”

“What I meant was, I didn’t harm either of them. I went back to my apartment and hung out with my friend Amai until I went to bed.”

My venlil exchange partner, Amai, is called to the stand.

“How long have you known Miss Ziva?” asks the center judge.

“Since the start of the Venlil-Human exchange program,” she answers nervously.

“And when was that?”

“I'm sure everyone knows—September 26th”

The center judge shuffles some papers idling on his desk. “What is the relation between you and Miss Ziva?”

Amai answers that we were friends—good friends. Answering another question, she admits that she was more comfortable around humans than the average venlil would be. Upon hearing this, the Prosecutor then asks Amai to give a full account of her actions on the day of the murder. Amai wouldn’t answer at first, but upon the insistence of the Prosecutor, she obliged.

“I was in my house,” Amai testifies shakily, “I felt tired that day so I remained inside for most of the day. When Ziva came home I ‘hung out’ with her.”

“What did you do when you ‘hung out’ with Miss Ziva?”

“We…We played a card game. I don’t remember which, but she also introduced me to one of her games called CLUE.”

The prosecutor observes that CLUE was a mystery game that involved a murder. After letting this thought sink in, he reminds the court that the average person do not play games involving murder.

“Did you do anything after playing clue?”

“We…We watched a movie…” her voice trails off.

“Could you please name the film that you watched?”

In a very low voice, she says that it was a picture with Desika in it.

The Prosecutor rises up and seems to even grow a couple of inches. “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let it be known that after pushing a venlil brutally to the ground, Miss Ziva played a game involving murder, and watched a crime show. That is all I have to say.”

Amai bursts into tears. “You have got it all wrong!” she says, “it wasn’t even like that! I know Ziva! I know for a fact in my heart that she is completely innocent!” By the time one of the bailiffs lead her away, she’s a blubbering mess. “You have to understand! You have to understand!” she says before the swinging doors close, but no one seems to understand.

The hearing continues.

“Remember the testimony of Mr. Banek, who said the crime took place in the early morning?”

I nod. His tail is in a flurried state, as if a million amps were running through him.

“That means you also heard him testify that the lacerations were consistent with a serrated knife?”

I agree with him. After a brief pause, he speaks again.

“Recall Mrs. Ronnolek’s testimony, the utility vendor. Recall that she testified that she sold you three items around the time of midnight: a serrated knife, bleach, and towels.”

“Okay, but as I’ve testified before—”

“Yes, you lost it,” says the Prosecutor in a sarcastic tone, “somehow, you lost the knife! On the very day right after the murders took place! Isn’t that oddly convenient?”

“Convenience aside, I’d like to point out that the district where I lost the knife has a high population of pickpockets. The knife may have been stolen from me.”

The Prosecutor’s tail swishes. “So no comparison between your knife and the lacerations made on the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That’s also rather convenient, isn’t it, Miss Ziva?”

“Convenient or inconvenient, I am innocent of the crime you are accusing me of! This should be a point in my favor.”

Was it true that on that night, I had pushed a venlil aside in anger? True. Was it true that I was angry at them? True. And was it true that I had gone up to Klainis’s house with murder on my mind, and was it also true that I had indeed commited murder 3 times in a row? No, that fact was not true.

“You know all the evidence, you’ve heard all the facts,” booms the Prosecutor with his final summation, “We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have DNA evidence—Hair strands. We have sufficient motive. You heard Miss Ziva explain how she bought a knife, the very same knife used to do the murders, right before the murders took place! But most of all, we have three dead venlil. One of them had committed the act of racism, but was that act so heinous, so great as it warranted a death sentence?”

He picks up a serrated knife and twirls it around his paws, spinning it before the jury’s eyes like a magician twirling his hat.

“Miss Ziva, I submit, is not a hot-headed individual who acts on impulses! No, she is a murderer of the much colder type!”

He inspects each serration individually with one of his paws. “Consider! Not just one lethal cut to the throat, but many cuts and stabs across the entire body, all of which were non-lethal! This means she sliced them meticulously…and let them bleed to death!”

The jury shivers collectively, and a weird tension fills the room. It’s suffocating.

“I’m done talking. You all know what to do.”ㅤ

The jury only deliberates for five minutes before they annouce they had returned with a verdict. I'm led back into the courtroom and guided to the podium, and I barely have time to look at the presiding judge before he starts speaking.

“You are a particularly cold and emotionless person, Miss Ziva,” booms the center judge, “my fleece runs cold just by looking at you. By the powers vested in me, I order you to serve three consecutive life sentences, one for each of your victims.”

A wave of nausea bears down on me, and my legs go wobbly. The judge then asks me if I had anything more to add, but I’ve already stopped listening altogether. The last thing I remember before passing out is a collection of footsteps to my side.
